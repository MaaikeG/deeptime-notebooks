Deeptime notebooks
==================

This repository contains notebooks which are used to render the website [deeptime-ml.github.io](https://deeptime-ml.github.io/). In order to save time when making changes to the documentation, the notebooks are stored *including* the result cells. By doing this, they do not have to be completely executed but only the ones that changes were made to.

There are two utility scripts, `run.sh` and `clear.sh`, which run all notebooks and store the result in their respective output cells as well as clear all notebook output cells, respectively.

This repository is included into deeptime as a git submodule.
